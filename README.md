Project Name- <b><u>Responsive job portal website</u></b>
Problem Statement-
<u>Personalization</u>: Current platforms often overwhelm users with irrelevant listings. 
<u>Skill-based matching</u>: Can you go beyond traditional keyword searches and match candidates based on their actual skills assessed through gamified tests or project-based tasks?
Are there underserved communities or industries with unique hiring needs? 
<u>Integration with learning platforms</u>: Can you bridge the gap between job search and skill development by integrating with learning platforms and offering skill-building resources alongside job listings?
